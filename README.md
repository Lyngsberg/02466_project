Data
```

```text
ðŸ”§ Self-Generated Data
```

```text
The dataset is generated by sampling from three different functions:  
- A second-order polynomial  
- A third-order polynomial  
- A smooth function  

These are implemented in Python. A custom function samples a user-defined number of data points uniformly from a specified range. To simulate real-world conditions, noise (uniform or Gaussian) can be added to the sampled values. The magnitude and type of noise are configurable parameters.

The sampling range and noise level can be adjusted to test the robustness and performance of the models under different conditions. To ensure reproducibility, a fixed random seed (`42`) is used during data generation.

All datasets are saved with filenames in the format:
```

```scc
train_x(_n)_u.pkl
```

```text
Where:
- `x` refers to the function type:  
  - `q` for quadratic  
  - `c` for cubic  
  - `s` for smooth  
- `_n` (optional) indicates added noise  
- `u` encodes the lower and upper sampling bounds  

The choice of range significantly affects the shape of the generated data. For example, sampling the cubic function in a narrow interval around zero may produce data that appears quadratic.

Quadratic and cubic functions are included to evaluate whether the **Polynomial Network (PN)** can learn functions similar to its own structure. The smooth function introduces dissimilarity and tests the modelâ€™s ability to generalize to more complex, unfamiliar patterns.

Real-World Data
```

```text
The real-world dataset used in this project is the Combined Cycle Power Plant dataset:
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/combined+cycle+power+plant

It includes:
- 9568 data points  
- 5 continuous variables:  
  - Temperature (T)  
  - Ambient Pressure (AP)  
  - Relative Humidity (RH)  
  - Exhaust Vacuum (V)  
  - Energy Output (target variable)

This dataset is publicly available, free to use and share, and contains no personal or sensitive data. It is therefore safe and appropriate for use in this project.

It was downloaded in the form of an Excel file:
```

```scc
Folds5x2_pp.xlsx
```
